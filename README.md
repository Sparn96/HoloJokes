# HoloJokes
Hololens tech with Microsoft Cognitive API

#Project Goals
Interaction with a bot can be quite a drag, so thats why we made one with a sense of humor! Our program uses Microsoft's Cognitive Services APIs in order to contol a bot that really enjoys puns.

Luckily the bot cares about what you think! It analizes your reaction to each joke and learns which jokes you enjoy more than others and adjusts according to your tastes.

You can also tell the bot a joke and see its reaction. 

HoloLens support! You can become the bot and see how people react to your jokes. 

The bot has learned over 60,000 jokes! So you're bound to hear a new lame pun everytime!
